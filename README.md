## Instructions
Into the specified form fields, type in information about a made-up train. Feel free to be as creative as you like. Include the name of your train, your destination, its first departure that day, and how often it runs(in minutes, use numbers only). When you click submit, your train information will populate in the "Current Train Schedule" section. It will be below any other trains that have already been added. 
With minimal information inputted, this game calculates for you when you can expect your next train.

## Project Status
For the parameters now, it is complete. However, a "nice to have" feature would be to add in an API for Amtrak, or another train company. As of right now the trains on this game are made up, just to show the user how the game works. Ideally, if I were to add an API, the user could select their train, and have the same information populate regarding next train / how many minutes away.
